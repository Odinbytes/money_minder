# **Money_minder API**

This is a RESTful API that allows users to track their income and expenses over time.

## **Features**
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for income and expenses.
- Generate reports on monthly and yearly spending.
- Set budget limits and receive alerts when the budget threshold is exceeded.
- (Optional) Visualize income and expenses using charts in a full-stack version.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend Framework**: Node.js (Express) or Flask (Python) â€“ your choice

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   - For **Node.js + Express**:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - For **Flask**:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Set up the environment:**
   - Create a `.env` file to store environment variables such as your database connection string.
   
   Example `.env` file:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
   ```

4. **Run the server:**
   - For **Node.js + Express**:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - For **Flask**:
